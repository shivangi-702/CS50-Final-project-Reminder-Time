# CS50-Final-project-Reminder-Time
For my CS50 final project i decided to make an ios app using SwiftUI.  my app is called Reminder Time  Users are allowed to make new reminders, where they create a heading, followed by either paragraphs, notes or even lists. Following this, the reminder can have a set date and time on when to go off. Users are allowed to make as many reminders as they desire, and when they want to delete one, they are given the opportunity to do so by sliding their reminder to the left.
